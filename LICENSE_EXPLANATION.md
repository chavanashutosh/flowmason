## Overview

The FlowMason License is a **custom proprietary license** that allows free personal use while restricting commercial use, distribution, and competition. It's designed to protect the intellectual property while allowing individuals to use the software for personal projects.

**Key Principle**: Free for personal/localhost use, commercial license required for business/commercial use.

---

## Section-by-Section Explanation

### 1. PURPOSE OF THIS LICENSE

**What it means:**
- FlowMason is intended for **personal, private use** on your own device
- You cannot use it commercially, host it publicly, redistribute it, or sell it without explicit written permission
- This is a **restrictive license** - the opposite of open-source licenses like MIT or Apache

**In simple terms:** Use it yourself, don't make money from it, don't share it widely.

---

### 2. FREE USAGE CONDITIONS

**What you CAN do (all must be true):**
- Run it on your personal computer/laptop
- Access it only yourself (single user)
- Use it on localhost (127.0.0.1 or localhost)
- Use it for personal projects

**What you CANNOT do (without paying):**
- Run it on a public domain (like `myapp.com`)
- Deploy it on company servers (even internal ones like `dev.company.local`)
- Share it with others or allow multiple users
- Charge money for access or workflows
- Use it to automate tasks for clients/customers
- Deploy it on shared infrastructure (VPS, cloud servers)

**Real-world examples:**

**ALLOWED:**
- Running `http://localhost:3000` on your laptop
- Using `http://127.0.0.1:3000` for personal automation
- Building personal workflows for your own use

**NOT ALLOWED:**
- Deploying to `mycompany.com`
- Running on `dev.mycompany.local` (internal company network)
- Hosting on AWS/DigitalOcean for others to access
- Using it to automate tasks for paying clients

**Important:** ALL conditions must be met. If even one fails, you need a commercial license.

---

### 3. HOSTED OR PUBLIC DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

**If you deploy FlowMason outside localhost** (even with permission), you must:

1. **Display Attribution:**
   - Show: "Built using FlowMason — https://github.com/chavanashutosh/flowmason"
   - Must be visible and readable (not hidden in source code)
   - Should be in the UI footer or "About" page
   - Cannot be minimized or hidden

2. **Preserve Branding:**
   - Cannot remove or replace "FlowMason" branding
   - Cannot rename the software
   - The original name must remain visible

**Why this matters:** Even if you get permission to deploy publicly, you must give credit and maintain the FlowMason identity.

---

### 4. COMMERCIAL RESTRICTIONS

**Without a commercial license, you CANNOT:**

- **Sell access** - Charge users to use your FlowMason instance
- **SaaS model** - Offer FlowMason as a Software-as-a-Service
- **Paid integrations** - Include FlowMason in systems you charge for
- **Client workflows** - Charge clients for workflows built with FlowMason
- **Corporate deployment** - Use it in any business environment
- **Automation services** - Offer automation services powered by FlowMason
- **Monetize integrations** - Sell integrations or connectors built in FlowMason

**Bottom line:** If money is involved (yours or others'), you need a commercial license.

### 5. MODIFICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

**This project is open to contributors!** Contributions are welcome through Pull Requests to the original repository at https://github.com/chavanashutosh/flowmason.

**What you CAN do:**
- Modify the code for your personal use
- Keep modifications private
- Submit improvements as Pull Requests (contributions are encouraged)
- Contribute back to the original project

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Fork the repository publicly on GitHub
- Publish your modified version as a separate repository
- Share modified versions with others
- Create derivative works under a different name

**Key point:** Modifications are allowed but must stay private or be contributed back upstream. You cannot create your own version of FlowMason. The project welcomes contributions from the community.

---

### 6. NO FORKS, MIRRORS OR DISTRIBUTION

**Strictly prohibited:**
- Public forks on GitHub/GitLab/etc.
- Reposting source code anywhere
- Sharing binaries or compiled versions
- Distributing copies (even privately)
- Sublicensing (giving others permission to use it)
- Repackaging under a different name

**Why:** The original repository is the **only** legitimate source. This prevents fragmentation and ensures all users get updates from the same place.

**Exception:** You can download and use it yourself, but cannot redistribute it.

---

### 7. TELEMETRY & IDENTIFICATION

**If telemetry is added in the future:**
- You consent to anonymous usage tracking
- Metrics may include: how often you use it, which features you use, version information
- This helps improve the software

**If you disable telemetry:**
- Your usage is limited to localhost only
- You cannot deploy publicly if telemetry is disabled

**Purpose:** Helps developers understand usage patterns and improve the product.

---

### 8. NON-COMPETITION CLAUSE

**You CANNOT build or release:**
- Competing integration platforms (like Zapier, n8n, Make.com)
- Workflow builder services
- Brick-based automation frameworks
- Any product that directly competes with FlowMason

**Even if:** You implement it differently, use different technology, or call it something else.

**What you CAN build:**
- Private internal workflows (for yourself)
- Connectors (contribute back to FlowMason)
- Personal extensions
- UI improvements (contribute back)

**Key distinction:** You can build things FOR FlowMason, but not build things LIKE FlowMason.

**Why:** Protects the business model and prevents competitors from using FlowMason as a starting point.

---

### 9. TERMINATION OF LICENSE

**Your license ends immediately if:**
- You deploy outside permitted scope (e.g., public domain)
- You remove required attribution
- You use it commercially without a paid license
- You fork or distribute it

**When terminated, you must:**
- Stop using the software immediately
- Delete all copies within 72 hours
- Stop allowing others to access it

**No grace period:** Termination is immediate, but you get 72 hours to remove it.

---

### 10. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE

**Legal jurisdiction:**
- Republic of Austria – Vienna Commercial Court
- Even if you're outside Austria, you agree to Austrian law
- Disputes will be handled in Austrian courts

**Why this matters:** If there's a legal dispute, it will be resolved under Austrian law, not your local laws.

---

### 11. LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

**Standard "AS IS" disclaimer:**
- Software comes with **no warranty**
- FlowMason developers are **not liable** for:
  - Financial losses from using the software
  - Automation mistakes or side effects
